# Strategies

Congratulations! You've made it this far. Now that you're ready to start using Push Money to earn some great yields, let's look at some basic strategies you can follow as a framework for your own investment strategy. We'll break things down by complexity and relative risk, so feel free to mix and match elements according to your own level of experience, investment goals, and risk tolerance.

### Semi-active Restaking Strategy

Once you have familiarized yourself with the Push Money protocol and how everything works, you might be interested to try a more active and advanced strategy to diversify your passive income streams and potentially increase yields.

One way to do this would be to buy some PUSH and pair it with BTCB to receive PUSH-BTCB LP tokens. (Refer to the [Provide LP](../helpful-guides/provide-lp.md) section for instructions on how to do this.) You can then stake those LP tokens in our [Farms](../protocol/farms.md) to earn PSHARE, which you can then withdraw on a regular basis and stake in the [Boardroom](../protocol/boardroom.md) to earn additional PUSH when above peg and the Boardroom is printing.

What you do with the PUSH you earn then is up to you. You could stake it for [xPUSH](../protocol/xpush-push-staking.md), sell it immediately on the open market.

### **More Complex/Active Strategies**

As the Push Money ecosystem grows, more complex, advanced, and active strategies will emerge. Once you fully understand the protocol and how all its mechanisms interact, feel free to experiment.

Keep in mind these fundamental aspects of the protocol when you are thinking about how to most optimally balance your portfolio:

1. The Boardroom only prints for PSHARE stakers **when the peg is above 1.01**.
2. The higher PUSH is above peg, the **more PUSH is printed for PSHARE stakers in the Boardroom**. This makes staking PSHARE more attractive the higher above peg we currently are.
3. Conversely, PSHARE becomes less attractive as PUSH dips below peg.

Ultimately, the goal of an advanced user of the protocol should be to help maintain the peg. Doing so will result in the greatest rewards for not only yourself as an individual, but for every person participating in the protocol as a whole.

Strategically rebalancing your portfolio to apply buying pressure to PUSH when below peg, or selling pressure when above peg, can be a very profitable strategy, but is not without risk. As such, this type of strategy is for experienced users only.
